![GroupBuy project](GrouBuy.jpg)
### New Features:

1. **Group Buying Only**:  
   Products can only be purchased through group buys, encouraging collective purchasing.

2. **Join or Create Groups**:
   - You can **join an existing group** for the product you want or **create your own group**:
     a) **Joining a group** is easy. Simply jump into the group. For private groups, you'll need a password, which can be obtained from the group owner.
     
     b) **Creating your own group** allows you to choose between public and private settings. For private groups, a password will be automatically generated and displayed in your profile.

## Group Buying Explanation
- Products can only be bought in groups. You can either join an existing group or create your own.
- **Joining Groups**: Public groups are open for anyone to join, while private groups require a password. Passwords can be obtained from the group owner.
- **Creating Groups**: Users can create a public or private group for a product. If private, the system generates a password that will be sent to your profile.

## Easy installation in 3 steps
1. Import `database.sql` to your MySQL database.
2. Set hostname, username, and password in `application/config/database.php`.
3. Set your site domain in `application/config/config.php` as `$config['base_url'] = 'http://yourdomain.com';`
4. Enjoy! :)

If youâ€™re installing the project in a subdirectory (e.g., http://localhost/SHOP), set this directory in `application/config/config.php` as `$config['base_url'] = 'http://localhost/SHOP';`. Also, remove the "RewriteBase /" line from the `.htaccess` file to ensure CSS and JS files load correctly. For best results, install the platform at the root level (http://localhost), or set up a virtual host for custom directories (example: http://shop.dev -> point to localhost/shop). You can read about setting up virtual hosts here: http://goo.gl/UvpYMG

## Docker 
* more info comming soon ...
`1) sudo docker-compose build
2) sudo docker-compose ps
3) sudo docker-compose up`
  
## Login to administration with:
User: `admin`,  
Pass: `admin`

## Vendor Support
Login URL: `vendor/login`. Vendors are not supported only in the "onepage" template.
To register a new vendor, visit: `vendor/register`. Vendors must be enabled from `/admin (administration) -> Settings -> Multi-Vendor Support`.

## User Registration
User registration/login is available in the greenlabel template. (Can easily be added to other templates by copying files: `login.php`, `signup.php`, `user.php` and modifying the design). Users can track their order history.
